<!--
Build a collapsing and expanding accordion component that will open page
elements, hiding and showing content when the title tab is clicked. Using the
following HTML as a template, add the completed script element and create the
desired functionality with JavaScript.

Take the following steps:
1. Using querySelectorAll(), select all the elements with a class of title.

2. Using querySelectorAll(), select all the elements with a class of myText.
This should be the same number of elements as the title elements.

3. Iterate through all the title elements and add event listeners that, once
clicked, will select the next element siblings.

4. Select the element on the click action and toggle the classlist of the
element with the class of active. This will allow the user to click the element
and hide and show the below content.

5. Add a function that will be invoked each time the elements are clicked that
will remove the class of active from all the elements. This will hide all the
elements with myText.
